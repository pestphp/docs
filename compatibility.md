## Compatibility

[`Pest runs together with PHPUnit and it can be installed in any PHP project!`](#)

In technical words, we can say that Pest is both: Framework agnostic and a Progressive Test Framework.

Pest does not depend on any particular Framework, and it can be installed in any modern PHP project.

As a Test Framework, Pest is 100% compatible with PHPUnit. In fact, Pest runs on top of it.

After installing Pest, your PHPUnit tests will simply continue to work! There is no need for massive code migration.

Your project can have both PHPUnit test classes and Pest tests in the same test suite. You can also reuse your Test Case classes in Pest test files.

Ready to install? It is just 3 steps: [`Installation →`](/docs/installation)

## Documentation examples

We feel that it's important to say that several examples in this documentation are referring to, or using, Laravel code syntax.

This is just because the author, Nuno Maduro, has a close relationship with the Laravel community.

You are welcome to create Pest content for your preferred Framework. Your community will `love it`!
