# Custom Expectations

Pest's expectation API is powerful by default, but there may be times when you need to write the same expectations repeatedly between tests. In such cases, creating custom expectations that meet your specific requirements can be incredibly useful.

Custom expectations are usually defined in the `tests/Pest.php` file, but you can also organize them in a separate `tests/Expectations.php` file for better maintainability. To create a custom expectation in Pest, chain the `extend()` method onto the `expect()` function without providing any expectation value.

For example, suppose you are testing a number utility library and you need to frequently assert that numbers fall within a given range. In this case, you might create a custom expectation called `toBeWithinRange()`:

```php
// Pest.php or Expectations.php
expect()->extend('toBeWithinRange', function (int $min, int $max) {
    return $this->toBeGreaterThanOrEqual($min)
                ->toBeLessThanOrEqual($max);
});

// Tests/Unit/ExampleTest.php
test('numeric ranges', function () {
    expect(100)->toBeWithinRange(90, 110);
});
```

While users typically utilize Pest's built-in expectations within their custom expectations as demonstrated in the `toBeWithinRange()` example, there may be times when you need to access the expectation value directly to perform your own custom expectation logic. In such cases, you can access the expectation value that was passed to `expect($value)` via the `$this->value` property.

```php
expect()->extend('toBeWithinRange', function (int $min, int $max) {
    echo $this->value; // 100
});
```

Of course, you probably want users to have the ability to "chain" expectations together with your custom expectation. To achieve this, ensure your custom expectation includes a `return $this` statement.

```php
// Pest.php or Expectations.php
expect()->extend('toBeWithinRange', function (int $min, int $max) {
    // Assertions based on `$this->value` and the given arguments...

    return $this; // Return this, so another expectations can chain this one...
});

// Tests/Unit/ExampleTest.php
test('numeric ranges', function () {
    expect(100)
        ->toBeInt()
        ->toBeWithinRange(90, 110)
        ->to...
});
```

Sometimes, you may need to trigger a test failure in your Custom Expectation. To do so, use the `test()` method in combination with the [`fail()`](/docs/exceptions) method.

```php
// Pest.php or Expectations.php
expect()->extend('toBeDivisibleBy', function (int $divisor) {
    if ($divisor === 0) {
        test()->fail('The divisor cannot be 0.');
    }

    return expect($this->value % $divisor)->toBe(0);
});

// Tests/Unit/ExampleTest.php
test('numeral division', function () {
    expect(10)->toBeDivisibleBy(2); // Pass
    expect(10)->toBeDivisibleBy(0); // Fail "The divisor cannot be 0."
});
```

## Intercept Expectations

Although it is considered an advanced practice, you can override existing expectations with your own implementation via the `intercept()` method. When using this method, the existing expectation will be fully substituted if the expectation value is of the specified type. For example, you can replace the `toBe()` expectation to check if two objects of the `Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model` type have the same `id`.

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use App\Models\User;

// tests/Pest.php or tests/Expectations.php
expect()->intercept('toBe', Model::class, function(Model $expected) {
    expect($this->value->id)->toBe($expected->id);
});

// tests/Feature/ExampleTest.php
test('models', function () {
    $userA = User::find(1);
    $userB = User::find(1);

    expect($userA)->toBe($userB);
});
```

Instead of passing a string type as the second argument to the `intercept()` method, you may also pass a closure, which will be invoked to determine whether or not to override the core expectation.

```php
expect()->intercept('toBe', fn (mixed $value) => is_string($value), function (string $expected, bool $ignoreCase = false) {
    if ($ignoreCase) {
        assertEqualsIgnoringCase($expected, $this->value);
    } else {
        assertSame($expected, $this->value);
    }
});
```

## Pipe Expectations

There may be instances where you want to run one of Pest's built-in expectations, but include customized expectation logic under certain conditions. In these cases, you can use the `pipe()` method. For example, we may want to customize the behavior of the `toBe()` expectation if the given value is an Eloquent model.

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use App\Models\User;

expect()->pipe('toBe', function (Closure $next, mixed $expected) {
    if ($this->value instanceof Model) {
        return expect($this->value->id)->toBe($expected->id);
    }

    return $next(); // Run to the original, built-in expectation...
});
```

As demonstrated, creating custom expectations can significantly simplify your code by eliminating the need to duplicate the logic to verify that your tests are behaving as anticipated.
